# Parallel_Sorting_with_MPI

This first exercise of this semester is about parallel sorting with MPI.
The Message Passing Interface (MPI) is an Application Program Interface that defines a model of parallel computing.
The key point in MPI is that each parallel process has its own local memory and we are talking about distributed systems, then processed data must be explicitly shared by passing messages between processes.
